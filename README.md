## Overview
My tech blog site focusing on quick tips and tutorials for all elements of the Web Development Stack

* Static website built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) used to build and bundle assets
* Site hosted on Netlify

## Building the Site
### Prerequisites

## Usage
## Deployment
The Jekyll site and assets are built by running various Gulp tasks. That main ones are:

### Default Task
`gulp`
* Used for development
* Compiles SASS, scripts
* Runs the __jekyll-build__ task to compile the site
* Launches BrowserSync to watch files

### Netlify Deploy
`gulp netlify-deploy`
* Builds a production version of the site to deploy on Netlify
* Similar to default task but minifies css/scripts
* Critical CSS is added inline
* BrowserSync not called
